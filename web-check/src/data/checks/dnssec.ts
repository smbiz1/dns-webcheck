    'which is what makes cache poisoning and on-path spoofing possible. DNSSEC signs ' +
    'records with public-key cryptography so a resolver can verify nothing was ' +
    'altered along the way. DoH and DoT address a different half of the problem by ' +
    'encrypting the query itself.',

    'Whether a zone is signed says something about how carefully its DNS is run. An ' +
    'unsigned zone is not a vulnerability on its own, but it removes one defence ' +
    'against an attacker already in a position to interfere with resolution.',
